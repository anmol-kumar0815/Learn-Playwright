1. test.beforeAll: When called in the scope of a test file, Runs before every test group. Run before every test if defined in a test group.  We can use it to perform some global setup, such as launching a browser or creating a context.

```
test.describe("Test suite", () => {
  test.beforeAll(async ({ page }) => {
    ...
  });

  test("test", async ({ page }) => {
    ...
  });
});
```

2. test.afterAll: Same as beforeAll, We can use it to perform some global teardown, such as closing the browser or deleting the context.
```
test.describe("Test suite", () => {
  test.afterAll(async ({ page }) => {
    ...
  });

  test("test", async ({ page }) => {
    ...
  });
});
```

3. test.beforeEach: When called in the scope of a test file, it runs before each test in the file. When called inside a test.describe() group, it runs before each test in the group. We can use it to perform some local setup, such as creating a page, navigating to a URL, or logging in.

```
test.describe("Test suite", () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    ...
  });

  test("test", async ({ page }) => {
    ...
  });
});
```

4. test.afterEach: When called in the scope of a test file, it runs after each test in the file. When called inside a test.describe() group, it runs after each test in the group. We can use it to perform some local teardown, such as reverting the actions performed during a test, taking screenshots, clearing cookies, or logging out.

```
test.describe("Test suite", () => {
  test.afterEach(async ({page}) => {
    ...
  });

  test("test", async({page}) => {

  });
});
```
