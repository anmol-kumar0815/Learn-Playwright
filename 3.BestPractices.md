### Locators

While using locators, we should prefer using them in the following order from most preferred to least preferred.

getByTestId (Most preferred)
getByTitle
getByRole
getByLabel
getByPlaceholder
getByAltText
getByText
locator (Avoid if possible)

### Avoid too many nested describe, test and step blocks

Playwright provides us with the ability to define as many nested describe or test blocks as we want. While this is useful in some cases, abusing this feature can make the code unreadable. Limit the maximum nesting of blocks to two.


### Avoid conditional logic within tests

Conditional logic in tests is usually an indication that a test is attempting to cover too much, and not testing the logic it intends to. Each branch of code executing within a conditional statement will usually be better served by a test devoted to it.


### Negative assertions

```
// Incorrect
await expect(locator).not.toBeVisible();

// Correct
await expect(locator).toBeHidden();
```

### Prefer strict equality assertions

```
// Incorrect
await expect({ a: "a", b: undefined }).toEqual({ a: "a" }); // true

// Correct
await expect({ a: "a", b: undefined }).toStrictEqual({ a: "a" }); // false
```

When using the toEqual method on an object, it returns true if the structure is similar. (Setting the value of a key to undefined evaluates the object to not have that key). Instead Using the toStrictEqual operator can catch the differences in the object shapes much more reliably.


### Use proper step blocks

```
test("should be able to place an order", ({ page, loginPage, ordersPage }) => {
  await test.step("Step 1: Login to the application", loginPage.loginViaUI);
  await test.step("Step 2: Create new order", () =>
    ordersPage.createOrders({ item: "Smartphone" })
  );
  await test.step("Step 3: Assert a new order was created", async () => {
    const orders = page.getByTestId("order");
    await expect(orders).toHaveCount(1);
  });
});
```

### Wait for the API responses
In a case that we have an API request associated with a user event, we should wait for the API response to arrive before moving on with the tests to avoid flakiness. There can also be cases where we have multiple API calls associated with a user action. In such cases we have created a custom method called interceptMultipleResponses which can intercept and wait for the completion of multiple request to the same URL pattern.

```
const fetchOrder = page.waitForResponse(/orders/i);
await page.getByTestId("submit-order-button").click();
await fetchOrder;
```
```
const fetchOrders = neetoPlaywrightUtilities.interceptMultipleResponses({
  url: "/orders/",
});
await page.getByTestId("submit-order-button").click();
await fetchOrders;
```

### Use i18n locales when asserting texts
In BigBinary, we have setup i18n in Playwright using the same translation strings that are being used in the products. When asserting strings, we should always use translations instead of hardcoded texts. This is because, the texts on screen are prone to changes as the application matures. This can lead to unintentional test failures for minor changes in the product leaving any major bugs in the product being uncaught due to early failures. Using i18n translations for textual assertions can make the tests more resilient towards minor changes in the product texts causing test failures.

```
// Incorrect
await expect(
  this.page.getByTestId("orders-count-label")
).toContainText("1 Order");

// Correct
await expect(
  this.page.getByTestId("orders-count-label")
).toContainText(this.t("common.countOf.pendingOrders", { count: 1 }));
```
